Summary: Pepsi’s Sting Strategy vs Red Bull

Red Bull built India’s energy drink market with premium pricing and strong branding. But it remained niche due to high costs and limited reach.  

Pepsi disrupted the space with Sting by:  
- Launching at half the price of Red Bull  
- Introducing smaller, value packs  
- Using its massive distribution to reach tier-2/3 cities  

Result: Sting expanded the market, captured mass consumers, and weakened Red Bull’s dominance.  

Key Insight: In price-sensitive markets, accessibility and distribution often beat premium branding.
