Case Study: How Pepsi’s Sting Strategy Challenged Red Bull in India

Overview
This repository explores how Pepsi disrupted Red Bull’s dominance in India’s energy drink market. Red Bull created the market with premium pricing and aspirational branding, but Pepsi’s Sting grew rapidly by making energy drinks affordable and widely available.

The Disruption
Pepsi launched Sting at ₹50, half of Red Bull’s price. It introduced smaller pack sizes for affordability, and leveraged its vast distribution to place Sting in kirana shops, highways, and tier-2/3 cities. Marketing focused on accessibility and instant energy rather than exclusivity.

The Impact
Sting expanded the energy drink market by reaching mass consumers who found Red Bull unaffordable. Over time, Sting captured significant market share, while Red Bull struggled to scale beyond urban elites.

Key Takeaways
- Red Bull relied too heavily on premium branding.  
- Pepsi localized pricing, pack sizes, and distribution to match India’s realities.  
- Affordability + accessibility can outcompete exclusivity in price-sensitive markets.  
- Distribution is a game-changer in FMCG battles.
